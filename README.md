[^1]: Extra life point.
[^2]: In all respects, he is a deputy until the regular sheriff dies.
If the regular sheriff kills him, he loses all his cards.
If he dies while secret, the game continues. He can be jailed like any other deputy.
Once the regular sheriff dies, the secret sheriff immediately reveals his role
card, and gets promoted to sheriff.
He does not gain a life, but his maximum does increase by one.
Once he has been revealed, he becomes the regular sheriff for all intents and
purposes. If the original sheriff comes back into the game, he does not resume
his role as sheriff, but rather as a deputy, with his maximum life played as such.

## General Rules
